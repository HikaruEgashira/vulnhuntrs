A tool to identify remotely exploitable vulnerabilities using Large Language Models (LLMs) and static code analysis.

**Autonomous AI-discovered 0day vulnerabilities**

</div>

Vulnhuntrs is a security analysis tool designed to detect vulnerabilities in applications. It provides static analysis capabilities to identify potential security issues in your codebase.

## Features

- Static code analysis for security vulnerabilities
- Support for multiple programming languages
- Detailed vulnerability reports
- Example vulnerable applications for testing

export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
cargo run -- -r example/python-vulnerable-app
```

- Rust app(`example/rust-vulnerable-app`) + GPT-4o-latest
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
cargo run -- -r example/rust-vulnerable-app -m gpt-4o
```
